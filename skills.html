                React I learned when making dashboards for our applications.

                stack development, I gained more academic knowledge on ReactJs.

                When learning blockchain development and Ethereum, I learned

                projects during college using Solidity including ERC20 and
                ERC721 tokens, IPFS, Oracles and sample DAPPs. You can explore

              <p class="text-center">
                When working with ReactJs, often you need to have application
                state, passing objects from parents to child components which
                would become trouble when working on large projects. That’s why
                I learned Redux. I usually kept authentication tokens inside
                redux states.

                NodeJs served me well when I needed high I/O operations on
                servers. When later I moved to MERN stack development Node
                served as a center pillar for my applications. Single thread and
                JS callback nature made it easy to handle async applications.
