                Java was forming backend for many of our enterprise

                JSF frontend. Java contributed a lot to my design patterns and

                When working with ReactJs, often you need to have applciation

                become trouble working on large projects. Thats why I learned
                Redux. I usually kept authentication tokens inside redux states.

                served as a center pillar for my applications. Single thread and
